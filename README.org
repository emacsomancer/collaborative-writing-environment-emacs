* Collaborative Writing with Emacs
More to be added here, but the generally idea is an Emacs setup for writing, especially collaborative writing (at least over the LAN).

I set this up on a Raspberry Pi (with Emacs installed to it), and then connect in from other machines with a script (included as a template here as =launcher.sh=).

Each person gets a different colour to indicate the part of the file they're editing.

Includes: =org-mode=, =fountain-mode=.

(A literate configuration is used as well: make changes in =init.org= tangle your config (i.e. generate =init.el= and =init.elc=) with ~C-u C-x C-s~.)
