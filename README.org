*  [[./_images/emacs-collab.png]] Collaborative Writing with Emacs
More to be added here, but the general idea is an Emacs setup for writing, especially collaborative writing (at least over the LAN). Clone this to a (brand new: don't overwrite your own Emacs config) location: ~git clone https://gitlab.com/emacsomancer/collaborative-writing-environment-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d~

The first time it's launched, it will tangle you a new config (you may want to go to ~/.emacs.d/init.org~ and edit the configuration appropriately, e.g. putting in your git username and email [if you use git; otherwise ignore!]).

I set this up on a Raspberry Pi (with Emacs installed to it), and then connect in from other machines with a script (included as a template here as =launcher.sh=). You could make a launcher button on your machine and have it run the =launcher.sh= script. (The script will either connect to the running Emacs daemon, or else launch a new Emacs daemon and then connect to it.)

Each person gets a different colour to indicate the part of the file they're editing.

Includes: =org-mode=, =fountain-mode=.

(A literate configuration is used as well: make changes in =init.org= tangle your config (i.e. generate =init.el= and =init.elc=) with ~C-u C-x C-s~.)
